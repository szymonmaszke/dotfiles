dotfiles
=========

My current Arch Linux setup files, main ideas:
	- keyboard oriented (zsh, neovim, i3-gaps, firefox)
	- minimalistic and fast (resource-wise and programming-wise)
	- visually pleasant
	- automated (everything starts as seen on the screenshots below (i3 layouts))

##Screenshots

###Desktop window
	- Starts other applications and acts like a desktop (it starts like that automatically!)

###Coding window
	- Allows to edit source codes and other text documents efficiently

###Browser
	- Firefox optimized for keyboard usage. Styled with stylish plugin

##TO-DO:
	- Fix prompt (so it fits the whole theme better)
	- Add tmux to coding window
	- Style XMind, Spotify and apvlv with oomox for better experience
	- Add play, stop, next, previous buttons to bar displaying spotify song
