My current Arch Linux setup files, main ideas:

	- keyboard oriented (zsh, neovim, i3-gaps, firefox, tmux, ...)
	- minimalistic and fast
	- visually pleasant
	- automated (everything starts as seen on the screenshots below (i3 layouts))

##Screenshots
==============

###Desktop window
------------------

**Starts other applications and acts similiarly to dekstop**

*(On screen: Two termite terminals with CLI-visualizer for music)*

###Coding window
-----------------

**Allows to edit source codes and do shell related tasks efficiently**

*(On screen: tmux, neovim, fzf, agnoster prompt, molokai theme)*
